# Letter of Credit on the Blockchain: Comparing Platforms for Trade Finance

## Abstract
Blockchain technology facilities multi-party applications that do not require the parties to trust each other,
that are failure-resistant due to their decentralized nature, and
that provide a consistent view on the transaction history. These
properties make blockchains attractive for decentralized finance
(DeFi), and in particular for trade finance, where parties do not
necessarily trust each other and aim at reducing their financial
risks. Traditionally, intermediaries like banks or fiduciaries
provide such services â€“ along with several inconveniences like the
increased risk of fraud due to antiquated systems and processes,
considerable settlement delays, and high costs.

In this work, we focus on the financial instrument Letter of
Credit (L/C), which is used to secure payments in international
trade. We propose a method for evaluating blockchains for DeFi
based on this use case. We adapt existing catalogues of criteria
for platform evaluation to fit the development and operation of
DeFi applications. After discussing and designing a prototype of
a typical L/C workflow, we implement it on selected blockchain
platforms. The evaluation rates the feasibility and usability of
the development process.
